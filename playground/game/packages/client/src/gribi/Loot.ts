//user needs to fetch the state trees

//fn returns with private stuff, Operation data
//private stuff goes into vault, Operation data goes into circuit with state trees (all circuits expect the trees)
//Operation data and proof goes to gribi (trees are popped in by verifier as well)
//system fn calls gribi with Operation data and proof and then updates the state accordingly
//client picks up changes to trees

//we could basically specify that any public state variables need to included as public inputs to the circuit
//then in the calldata we give the solidity contract the necessary information it needs to find that data (we just hash it)

//so then the operation goes like...
//pub inputs (slot, value) which is hashed with users address and merkle proof down on chain
//pub operations (what we already have)
//inf witnesses
